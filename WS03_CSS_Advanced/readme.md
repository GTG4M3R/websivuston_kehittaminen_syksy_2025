Module 3 - Advanced CSS Techniques

    Added Advanced CSS Techniques such as:
    
    - Transitions (a button that changes its background color smoothly when hovered over)
    - Animations (a div that moves from left to right continuously)
    - Pseudo-classes (a list where every other item has a different background color)
    - Filters (a grayscale filter to an image and remove it on hover)
    - Pseudo-elements (a blockquote with a decorative quote mark using pseudo-elements)

    No Artificial Intelligence such as Github copilot were used.
