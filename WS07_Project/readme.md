Module 7 - Project

In this module I combined skills gathered from earlier workshops
and combined it to one working website with 4 pages:
Home page, Services page, Pricing Page and Contact page.

The project website is about a car detailing business with simple
but visually appealing theme. I used Bootstrap and pictures from Pixabay in this project. 

Perplexity Pro and GitHub Copilot AI was used in this project for
website design, company logo creation, error correction, professional text content, and CSS/HTML validation.
